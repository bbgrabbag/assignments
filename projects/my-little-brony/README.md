tags: angular routes, services, controllers, $http, CRUD
goal: build a static website that interacts with a RESTful api

RESOURCES:

UPDATES:
2/24 630pm- created all html templates and angular components.
2-25 3am- get-all and post requests are functioning. form is validated w/ alert
2-25 345pm- delete and edit functions working

NEXT:

-style it professionally.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
-When making updates to an object, make it so the change doesn't happen in the view until it has updated in the database. for example, when an object is updated via user inputs, give it additional 'object.edditedProp' properties and push that object to the server. if it succeeds, then display those editted properties in the view. if not, display the original properties instead. This way no information is lost or written over.
