        <p>Utility worker <b>Henry Rodger Brinkle</b>, 63, has filed a lawsuit against the state of Florida claiming he was unjustly denied a lunch hour extension for sleeping through his regular noon lunch break. According to the report Brinkle says he's a 'narcoleptic diabetic', but that has not been confirmed by his doctor or employer. His wife, <b>Betsy Prue</b>, was not available for comment.</p>



        <p>On the day of the incident Fellow employee <b>Larry Bruno</b> says "I went to the trailer to get Henry for lunch, but he was out like a rock. I called his name several times out loud, but when I saw the drool coming out of his mouth I knew it was serious. I checked his pulse to make sure he was alive. He was. So I just went to Chik Fil A as usual".</p>



        <p>Despite a questionable history of narcolepsy and diabetes it's not clear whether the sleeping episode was caused by chronic health problems or just pure unbridled laziness. Prosecutors vehemently argue for the latter. Brinkle's boss, <b>Garn Redfellow</b> is quoted as saying "This ain't nothin new. He's about as productive as a dead quail. To tell you the truth it don't make much of a difference whether he's asleep on the job or not. I should have fired him years ago. If it wasn't for these d--- unions I'd have some real help around here".</p>



        <p>When asked about his chances of success at trial, Brinkle wrinkled his brow and looked at the sky for a poetically long duration. He eventually replied, "I just don't know these days. There just ain't no justice no more. It's in God's hands now. I really could use that 20 bucks for a new oil filter and a brake light ya know?". He dismisses the prospect of paying out $5000 in lawyer's fees saying quote "It's just all talk. That's what lawyers do. They just talk".</p>
