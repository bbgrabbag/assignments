tags: node module, location object constructors, grid constructor
goal: create the game battleship using purely node.js. 

pseudo:
-in a 10x10 grid, there are randomly placed ships taking up 2-5 spaces each.

each location is an instance of the Location constructor, which  provides info about the state of each coordinate (whether there is a ship, whether its been guessed hit or miss, and how it looks on the board)
